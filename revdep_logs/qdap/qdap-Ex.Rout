speech i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million 'twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see

let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live god's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who should 'scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in follow him friends we'll hear a play to morrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago we'll ha't to morrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in't could you not very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore ay so god be wi' ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wann'd tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn'd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' the throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha 'swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver'd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murder'd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon't foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim'd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i'll observe his looks i'll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play 's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the law's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember'd i humbly thank you well well well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst"

clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question

imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in

cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that's the french bet against the

gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for's turn he did comply with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purpose they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what is't to leave betimes give me your pardon sir i've done you wrong but pardon't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punish'd with sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was't hamlet wrong'd laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd his madness is poor hamlet's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brother's wager frankly play give us the foils come on i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i' the darkest night stick fiery off indeed no by this hand very well my lord your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side this likes me well these foils
